## Introduction

NetDocuments is a cloud-based document management platform designed for professional teams that need secure, compliant, and highly searchable content control. Built for organizations with strict governance requirements, it centralizes documents, emails, and related work product in a structured workspace, helping users manage matter- or project-centric content with consistent naming, versioning, and metadata. NetDocuments supports fast retrieval through indexing and advanced search, reducing time spent locating files across shared drives or inboxes.

Security is a core focus: encryption, granular access permissions, audit trails, and policy-based retention help organizations meet internal and regulatory expectations. Administrators can standardize document lifecycle rules, apply ethical walls, and monitor activity for risk management and compliance reporting. The platform also enables collaboration by allowing controlled sharing, co-authoring workflows, and consistent check-in/check-out behavior, while maintaining a single source of truth for critical files.

NetDocuments integrates with common productivity tools, including Microsoft 365, Outlook, and desktop applications, so users can save, file, and profile content without disrupting daily workflows. IT teams benefit from centralized administration, deployment options, and configurable security controls, making it suitable for enterprise environments. Whether used by legal, finance, or other knowledge-driven departments, NetDocuments delivers a professional-grade system for organizing, protecting, and operationalizing documents at scale.
